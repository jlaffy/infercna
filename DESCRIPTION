Description: When gene expression levels are averaged over large enough chromosomal regions they no longer reflect individual genes' activities. Instead, they reflect amplifications or deletions of parts of the genome, i.e. alterations in the chromosomal copy numbers (CNAs). <infercna> infers these alterations from RNA-sequencing expression data.
